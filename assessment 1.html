<h1> Moving into a big city</h1>
<p> My name is Abbie and I once lived in a <strong> small town south of Cambridge <strong>; where not much happened and a place in which everybody knew everyone </p>
<<p>I am glad to leave and start a new adventure in a bigger and more vibrant city where there are far more oppertunities for me</p>
